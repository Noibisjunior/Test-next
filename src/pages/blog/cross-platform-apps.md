Advocating for cross-platform applications can provide several advantages, including affordability, faster development times, and lower maintenance costs. While we do offer native application development services, we recommend cross-platform development as a cost-effective solution for clients seeking to optimize their resources. Recently, we successfully converted one client from two native applications to one cross-platform application, which saved them a significant amount of money annually.

Our team utilizes React Native, a platform created by Facebook in 2015 that powers several large brands such as Airbnb, Instagram, and Bloomberg. Our developers favor React Native and are currently building several apps on this platform. When suggesting cross-platform development to your clients, highlighting the success of larger brands that use React Native can be a compelling argument.

However, there are cases when cross-platform development may not be the best option. For instance, if the app requires heavy animations, intricate visual designs, or complex calculations, we may recommend native application development instead. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.
